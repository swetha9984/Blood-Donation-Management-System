Blood Donation Management System

Overview :
Based on the attributes and entities The Blood Donation Management System is designed to manage blood donation, storage, and distribution in an efficient manner. It maintains donors, hospitals, patients,blood banks, and requests for blood in such a way that blood can be made available when and where it is required.

Donors register and donate blood, which is stored in blood banks. When hospitals or patients need blood, they can order, and the system matches them with the available units of blood. It also tracks hospital needs and follows blood movement from banks to hospitals to provide a reliable and efficient supply chain.The system, which is based on a relational database of structured form, guarantees accuracy, avoids duplication, and keeps the right records on donations and appeals. This limits human errors as well as enhancing response times, particularly in times of emergency where timely blood availability is paramount.

Through automating the process of blood donation, the system maximizes efficiency, enhances recordkeeping, and provides prompt supply of blood to needy patients. It is an essential tool for health facilities,
blood banks, and medical practitioners, ultimately contributing to saving lives.
